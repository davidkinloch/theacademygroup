                                    <h4 class="subtitle">How are the participating students selected?</h4>
                                    <p>The Academy taps into the deep wells of often overlooked talent that exist in underserved  communities nationwide.
                                    <p>Students entering the Academy in elementary school are selected randomly by lottery. Those joining in high school are selected based on prior academic background, attendance and commitment to improving themselves and the world around them.</p>

                                    <h4 class="subtitle">How are the participating teachers and mentors selected?</h4>
                                    <p>Academy Faculty and staﬀ are selected by a rigorous process, requiring demonstration of prior excellence, observations of practice, in depth interviews and numerous references.

                                    <h4 class="subtitle">Can you explain the academic programming the Academy oﬀers in greater detail? What classes do students participate in?</h4>
                                    <p>The Academy oﬀers both academic programming, including support for core academic classes, intensive seminars, and  hands-on one-on-one support, a curriculum on justice and leadership development.</p>
                                    <p>Our students participate in a business curriculum – classes in economics, finance, accounting and entrepreneurship, and a justice curriculum – classes in social change, how to be engaged citizens.</p>
                                    <p>This summer, our rising high school seniors participated in college prep classes, as well as Harvard Business School case studies. In college prep, we worked on personal statements, talked through financial aid, and other basics of how to create a stellar college application.</p>

                                    <h4 class="subtitle">When is the Academy expected to expand into other cities?</h4>
                                    <p>We are focused on a successful pilot Summer Academy, and standing up the Chicago Academy this year. We anticipate establishing the Los Angeles Academy in 2018-2019.</p>

                                    <h4 class="subtitle">What type of employment opportunities will Academy graduates be able to expect?</h4>
                                    <p>The Academy guarantees a pathway to professional employment in companies across multiple sectors to all of its students who fulfill requirements and successfully graduate from college. We anticipate we will be in 10-15 sectors within the next 3-5 years. In addition to finance, we are currently looking at law, sports management, and entertainment, insurance, conservation and technology.</p>

                                    <p>In 2017, 63 students participated in the Summer Pilot Academy. In 2018, 300 students will enroll in the Academy. By 2019 we expect approximately 1000 students in the Chicago Academy.</p>

                                    <p>Academy students still attend traditional school. That remains a requirement of their participation. The Academy programming will make these students extraordinarily competitive – enriching successful academic careers with job and internship experience, leadership development, mentorship, entrepreneurship and start up experience. The Academy provides students the foundation to be successful in college, the workforce, and contribute in substantive ways to their communities.</p>

                                    <p>Clearly not all Academy students will elect to work in Academy Group companies. Our students will have broad interests and be extremely competitive in the job market.  For students who elect not to work with an Academy Group company, we will provide career guidance and support.</p>

                                    <h4 class="subtitle">Why is the Academy a superior academic path to traditional schooling?</h4>
                                    <p>The Academy does not replace traditional schooling. We expect students to remain in their home schools. The Academy Group works closely with our students "host" schools to provide an additional set of supports – from additional academics, to leadership development and paid internship opportunities – for young people from underserved communities that take place in the summer, on weekends and after school.</p>
